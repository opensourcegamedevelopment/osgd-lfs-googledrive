If you are remixing this project for your own, make sure you update credentials.json with your own app.

#Authorisation
The first time you run the app, it will prompt you to authorize access:

1. The app will attempt to open a new window or tab in your default browser. If this fails, copy the URL from the console and manually open it in your browser.

2. If you are not already logged into your Google account, you will be prompted to log in. If you are logged into multiple Google accounts, you will be asked to select one account to use for the authorization.

3. Click the Accept button.
The app will proceed automatically, and you may close the window/tab.
